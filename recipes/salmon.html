    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) frozen salmon filets</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 390 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray.

        </li>
        <li>Mix Dijon, honey, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl.

        </li>
        <li>Place frozen salmon fillets in the prepared air fryer basket. Place in the preheated air fryer and cook for 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Brush Dijon mixture over the fillets and continue to air-fry until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 more minutes.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pro Tip:</h4>
    You can line the bottom of the air fryer basket with foil or parchment paper, instead of spraying with cooking spray, if preferred.
